    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a student at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>, intently pursuing <em>Software Development</em>, and hoping to graduate as an accredited full stack Software Developer. I was recently admitted to <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a>, a world class university in Connecticut, United States. I'll therefore matriculate to campus this fall.</p>
    <p>Although not yet certain on what course to pursue in campus, I'm a great tech enthusiast, and might consider taking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer Science</span>. I equally like  <span style="font-weight: bold;">  Engineering</span>, and the Liberal Arts Curiiculum in Yale will enable me to integrate these two disciplnes. With no background in tech, Moringa School will equip me with critical programming skills and thus I'll be at par with other international students in a similar class at Yale.</p>
    <p>Also, I love reading blogs, and have always wished to become a blogger myself.</p>
